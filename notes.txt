== Pupil detection ==
We use Thresholding to get a binary
We use blob analysis to find circular shapes
We return only the biggest one
PupilThr: 108

Doesn't work when eye is looking down. Be more loose with circularity
Ellipse is a weird format in cv2

Since we have an ellipse we use it's center for pointing out the center and not the contour
