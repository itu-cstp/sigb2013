== Pupil detection ==
We use intensity-Thresholding( 108) to get a binary
We use blob analysis to find circular shapes,
then blob size thressholds 4200-6000 are used to find appropriate blobs.

Doesn't work when eye is looking down. Be more loose with circularity
Ellipse is a weird format in cv2

Since we have an ellipse we use it's center for pointing out the center and not
blob analysis on the the contour
