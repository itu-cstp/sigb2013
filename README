Hello,

In this .zip you'll find our implementation of assignment1 in Assignment1.py

At the top of the file there is an section for settings which impacts performance. 
Toggling these from true to false will disable features they represent (k-means, gradient weighting and hough transform). 
It will however also speed up the program severely

In sequences we've included only one default test sequence. 
We trust that you have more to try out the program with without damaging learnit servers further

In Recorded Results we've recorded some test runs of the program
