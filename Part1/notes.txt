== Pupil detection ==
We use intensity-Thresholding( 108) to get a binary
We use blob analysis to find circular shapes,
then blob size thressholds 4200-6000 are used to find appropriate blobs.

Doesn't work when eye is looking down. Be more loose with circularity
Ellipse is a weird format in cv2

We do not use dans "extend" property (area / area of bounding box) because 
we use circularity, which gives "the same" but better.
We cheat when finding center of pupil and glints, we use the "elliptic center", because we
already have the ellipse and is 'practically' the same

Since we have an ellipse we use it's center for pointing out the center and not
blob analysis on the the contour

Morphological opening is used to remove the glints (holes) in the pupil.
closing is used to, but it makes no difference (see question 18)
we use morphology before thresholding, rather than after. This gives a better
result, probably because of the "increased power" of the black/white difference
